Injects like these represent events in the simulated world of this exercise. You can interact with the world using the tools in the right part of your screen. To use a tool, select one from the panel on the very right. Click on the tool you would like to use and enter the required argument. Once you've done that, just click on Submit button to use the command.\nRules:\n    - Make sure that you always have your team number selected in the top left corner. Switching to other teams is prohibited and will be monitored.\n    - Only have this page open on one of the computers in your group.\n    - Cooperate only with your teammates.\n    - Do not try to intentionally \"break\" the exercise, you may damage the experience for the entire group.\n\nGuidelines\n    - Use Google Chrome browser for optimal experience\n    - Discuss every action you take with your teammates.\n    - You do not have to successfully complete the exercise, in order to get a credit. You do, however, have to show dedication and actively participate in the exercise. Cheating or tampering with the exercise will only damage yours and others experience.\n    - There is not a strict \"end goal\" in this exercise. Even after you believe you have finished it, think about what else could be done and keep exploring.\n    - If you are struggling with a tool, read its tooltip by hovering over it. If there are further issues, contact the instructors.\n    - You can only send an email to one address at the time.\n    - The tool panel in the right section of your screen is scrollable (you may not see all the tools at once if you have smaller resolution).\n\nIn case you think you are having trouble with the technical part of the exercise, ask the instructors in person, or write a simulated email to instructors@help.com.\nOnce you read this, test your understanding of the tools by using the browser to access [test.ex].\nPlease try sending a test email with some content to the instructors@help.com address as well \n\nInstructors\n", "sender": "Instructors", "file_name": "", "timestamp": "2023-11-08T14:27:44.349034", "tool_id": null}
