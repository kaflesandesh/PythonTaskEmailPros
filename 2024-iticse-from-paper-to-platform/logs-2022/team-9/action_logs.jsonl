{"action_log_id": 1, "action_type": "INJECT", "content": "Hello,This is an introductory inject. You have 10 minutes to read this and familiarize yourselves with the platform. Injects like this represent events in the simulated world of this exercise. You can interact with the world using the tool CLI in the right part of your screen. To use a tool, select one from the panel on the very right. This will print the tools prefix into the console. Every prefix must be followed by an argument, depending on the tool youre using. Hover over the tool to see its usage.The example usage of browser, for instance, would be VISIT some.page.com. There is an exception to this in the email tool which takes two arguments, the recipients address, and the email content (EMAIL TO aaa@bbb.com Hello, this is the content of the email.).Rules:    - Make sure that you always have your team number selected in the top left corner. Switching to other teams is prohibited and will be monitored.    - Only have this page open on one of the computers in your group.    - Cooperate only with your teammates.    - Do not try to intentionally \"break\" the exercise, you may damage the experience for the entire group.    - Be patient and do not spam commands into the CLI, the content you see only refreshes every 5 seconds.Guidelines    - Use Firefox browser for optimal experience    - Discuss every action you take with your teammates.    - You do not have to successfully complete the exercise, in order to get a credit. You do, however, have to show dedication and actively participate in the exercise. Cheating or tampering with the exercise will only damage yours and others experience.    - There is not a strict end goal in this exercise. Even after you believe you have finished it, think about what else could be done and keep exploring.    - If you are struggling with a tool, read its tooltip by hovering over it. If there are further issues, contact the instructors.    - You can only send an email to one address at the time, make sure to read the EMAIL tooltip for correct usage.    - The tool panel in the right section of your screen is scrollable (you may not see all the tools at once if you have smaller resolution).    - The real length of the exercise is 5 minutes shorter than the timer shows (a reminder inject will be sent). Use those last 5 minutes to ***save the html*** of this page, you will need it in later exercises. This page will no longer be accessible once the exercise concludes.In case you think you are having trouble with the technical part of the exercise, ask the instructors in person, or write a simulated email to instructors@help.com.Once you read this, test your understanding of the CLI and tools by sending a test email with some content to the instructors@help.com address.
